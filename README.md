## Inspiration & Overview:

The idea for History Mate came mostly from the many educational and interesting animated history documentary channels currently thriving on youtube. I greatly enjoy these channels, and wanted to try to creating an app in this genre as a way to develop my backend and frontend skills.

## Features

When signed up and logged into the app, a user is able to view the real-life locations of points in a historical event, e.g. Significant battles of the Thirty Years' War. They can learn about these specific points, and test their knowledge with a small quiz, which allows them to unlock further points in the historical event/conflict, and related educational content. 

A user can also learn about the background/prelude to the historical event, as well as the main figures/persons.

## Tech Summary
- HTML/CSS/Typescript
- React + Redux Toolkit + Leaflet + Redux Toolkit Query (RTKQ)
- Nest.js + Typescript + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL + Passport JWT authentication
